# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Well -- it would, if there were actually any versioning.  Since its just a way
of saying hello, I did not actually create versions, I have "master" and "dev"
as my way of making updates.


## [Unreleased]
